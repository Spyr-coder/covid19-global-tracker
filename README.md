🌍 COVID-19 Global Tracker

This project analyzes real-world COVID-19 data from different countries, focusing on case numbers, deaths, and vaccination trends. Using Python tools, it presents a data-driven story of how the pandemic unfolded globally.

🧭 Project Objectives

- Import and clean global COVID-19 data
- Analyze trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Compare key metrics across countries
- Visualize insights through line plots and bar charts
- Summarize key takeaways in a clear and meaningful way


🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly (optional, for interactive maps)

 ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Open it in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with the Jupyter extension.
3. Run all cells in order (Kernel > Restart & Run All).
4. Ensure the dataset `owid-covid-data.csv` is placed in the same directory as the notebook.

📊 Key Insights

- The U.S. recorded the highest confirmed cases throughout the pandemic, followed closely by India and Brazil.
- Vaccination campaigns significantly reduced death rates in many countries after mid-2021.
- Countries with consistent testing (like Germany) maintained lower positivity rates.
- There were strong correlations between low vaccination rates and continued surges in deaths in under-resourced countries.

💬 Reflections

This project helped me understand not just data analysis techniques, but also how real-world events like a pandemic can be explored using Python and visual storytelling. It was insightful to see how different countries responded, and how data can uncover meaningful narratives.
